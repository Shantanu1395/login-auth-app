# login-auth-app
Login authentication app using django as a backend and react-native for UI

Backend - 
Run backend by python manage.py runserver 0:8000, it will run on 0.0.0.0(when we are running the react-native we need our backend on the same network - connect laptop and mobile with hotspot and enable usb debugging)

UI -
If backend is running on local, enter laptop's IPV4 address in the backend API (App.js)
